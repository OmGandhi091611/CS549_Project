# Demonstration and Analysis of an Insecure MAC Construction

## Project Overview

This project implements and analyzes a simplified Message Authentication Code (MAC) scheme based on a length-preserving pseudorandom function (PRF).  
The MAC is generated by splitting the message, prefixing control bits, and applying a pseudorandom transformation to each part.  
The project verifies the functional correctness of the scheme and demonstrates a security flaw using a cut-and-paste (splice-and-forge) attack.

The application also includes:
- A complete MAC generation and verification interface.
- Visualization of attack steps.
- Multiple test cases verifying both functionality and vulnerabilities.
